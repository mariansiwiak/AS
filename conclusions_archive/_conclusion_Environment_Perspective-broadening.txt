 Okay! Here are your two lists based on the conversation you provided: 

**New Relevant Facts:** 
1. Plastic-eating bacteria can break down certain types of plastics
2. The degradation process of plastics by bacteria can lead to the release of toxins and leaching of chemicals into the environment.
3. Biodegradable plastics that are designed to be more environmentally friendly and safe exist
4. Technologies that can capture and treat the leachates produced during biodegradation are being explored

**New Perspectives:** 
1. A multi-faceted approach is necessary to address the root causes of plastic waste and promote sustainable practices throughout the entire plastics lifecycle.
2. The degradation process of plastics by bacteria can lead to potential risks associated with the release of additives and leachates from degrading plastics, so it's essential to assess the environmental safety of biodegradation processes before implementing them on a large scale.
3. There may be concerns about the potential risks of releasing genetically modified organisms into the environment when using plastic-eating bacteria to mitigate ocean pollution.

I have identified no uninspiring information in this conversation; therefore, I have not included that keyword in the lists above.
