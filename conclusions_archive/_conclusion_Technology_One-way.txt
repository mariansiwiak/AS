 Based on the conversation history provided, here are the two lists you requested:

**New Relevant Facts**

1. The use of CRISPR technology for germline editing raises ethical concerns.
2. Synthetic biology has the potential to revolutionize the development of novel therapies for a wide range of diseases.
3. Genome engineering techniques like CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to modify the genes of diseased cells to correct genetic mutations or delete harmful genes altogether.
4. Synthetic biology can be used to design microbes that produce therapeutic proteins or metabolites, such as artemisinin and insulin.
5. Biosensors can be engineered to detect specific biomarkers associated with diseases, allowing for earlier diagnosis and treatment.
6. The development of novel therapies through synthetic biology has the potential to find new cures for diseases that were previously untreatable.

**New Perspectives**

1. The user contributed a valuable insight by highlighting the ethical considerations surrounding the use of CRISPR technology for germline editing.
2. The user also brought up the potential of synthetic biology to revolutionize the development of novel therapies, which was an interesting perspective that had not been discussed in the original response.

After analyzing the conversation, I have determined that it does not contain any uninspiring information or perspectives. All the points brought up by the user were relevant and added value to the discussion. Therefore, I will not use the **uninspiring** keyword for this conversation.
