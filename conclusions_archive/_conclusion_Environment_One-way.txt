 Here are two lists as requested:

**New Relevant Facts:**

1. Recycling one ton of aluminum saves 80% of the energy required to produce a new ton of aluminum.
2. The production of primary aluminum involves high energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions, while recycling aluminum requires only about 5% of the energy needed for primary production.
3. Recycling one ton of aluminum saves around 4 metric tons of CO2e emissions.
4. Recycling aluminum can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95% compared to producing primary aluminum.

**New Perspectives:**

1. The conversation highlights the importance of considering the entire lifecycle of materials, including their production and disposal, when assessing their environmental impact.
2. Recycling is an important practice that can help reduce the effects of global warming by conserving natural resources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, supporting renewable energy, and reducing waste disposal. 
3. The cradle-to-grave approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact of materials and helps make informed decisions about their use.

**Uninspiring:** None of the above information or perspectives offer a new, coherent, or valuable insight that was not already provided in the initial conversation.
