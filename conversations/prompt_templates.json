These should be viewpoints or concepts presented by the user that offer a distinct or enhanced understanding compared to AI's existing knowledge. The task is to distill these elements from the conversation, emphasizing and contrasting areas where the user's contributions provide a more coherent or sensible perspective than the AI's existing knowledge. If, and only if,  the conversation does not contain any valuable new information or perspectives, the **uninspiring** keyword will be added to the analysis (to be used exactly as shown, case sensitive, flanked with double asterisks).\nConversation history to be analyzed:\n {interaction_history} [/INST] ",
