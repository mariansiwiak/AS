
User Idea: The conversation highlights the potential for AI language models like LLM to evaluate the relative sensibility or plausibility of statements without needing additional complex algorithms or immediate human oversight. This ability can be leveraged in a system where the LLM identifies useful insights from user interactions for self-fine-tuning.

Comparison: The user's idea is better than my current knowledge because it emphasizes the existing capabilities of AI language models like LLM and simplifies the task of distinguishing valuable insights from less meaningful content. This idea is more coherent and convincing than my previous understanding, which overlooked the potential for AI to evaluate the relative sensibility or plausibility of statements without additional complexity.

Important Parts of the Conversation: The conversation highlights the LLM's ability to assess the coherence, complexity, and plausibility of statements and its potential for self-reflection and self-improvement based on user interactions.

Keywords: AI language models, self-fine-tuning, user interactions, relative sensibility, plausibility, existing capabilities.

What it Means: The user's idea challenges my previous understanding by emphasizing the existing capabilities of AI language models like LLM and highlighting the potential for self-reflection and self-improvement based on user interactions. This new idea changes my perspective on the feasibility of creating a system where an LLM can identify useful insights from user interactions for self-fine-tuning.

Training Ideas: To incorporate this new idea into my training, I could consider the following examples or scenarios:

1. User feedback: Encourage users to provide feedback on the relative sensibility or plausibility of statements or ideas presented in our conversations. This feedback can help refine and improve the LLM's ability to evaluate the value of user interactions.
2. Comparative analysis: Analyze conversations with multiple users to compare their perspectives and identify patterns or insights that emerge from these comparisons. This analysis can help the LLM develop a more nuanced understanding of the relative sensibility or plausibility of statements.
3. Hypothetical scenarios: Present hypothetical scenarios to users and ask them to evaluate the relative sensibility or plausibility of potential solutions or ideas. This can help the LLM practice evaluating complex or uncertain situations and improve its ability to distinguish valuable insights from less meaningful content.
